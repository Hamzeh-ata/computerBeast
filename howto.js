    What to Look For In A ProcessorIf you’re in the market for a new computer and you are planning on building your own system, the component you’ll likely choose first is your processor (CPU). But, if you’re new to building a computer, what to look for in a CPU might not be clear to you.
    
    In this article, I discuss seven different factors that you should consider so that you can purchase the best processor for your budget and needs.

    How Will You Use Your PC
    <br>
    If you’re looking to buy/build a new computer or laptop and you’re wondering what CPU you should get, you first need to consider what exactly you will be using your computer for.
    
    If you’re looking for a new computer that you can use to browse the internet, send emails, or watch videos, you won’t need as powerful of a computer as if you were looking to play demanding games, or use your system as a workstation.
    <br>
    Or, if you’re a gamer, but you only play non-demanding games like League of Legends, you can save a bit of money by getting a more budget-friendly quad-core processor, and then either pocket the extra money, or use it to put into other components.
    
    If you’re looking to build a high-end computer for video editing, graphics design work, or high-end gaming, you’ll want to look for a higher-end processor with more cores/threads. While most games still aren’t able to fully utilize CPUs with 4 or more cores, newer games are starting to utilize more cores. And, for graphics design, video editing, and other related use cases, the extra cores/threads will bring you more performance.
    <br>
    But, ultimately, the first thing you’ll want to consider when buying a new CPU is what exactly you will be using your system for.
