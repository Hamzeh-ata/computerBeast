            What to Look for In A CPU: 7 Factors to Consider
            <br>

            What to Look For In A ProcessorIf you’re in the market for a new computer and you are planning on building your own system, the component you’ll likely choose first is your processor (CPU). But, if you’re new to building a computer, what to look for in a CPU might not be clear to you.
            
            In this article, I discuss seven different factors that you should consider so that you can purchase the best processor for your budget and needs.

            1. How Will You Use Your Computer?
            
            How Will You Use Your PC
            <br>
            If you’re looking to buy/build a new computer or laptop and you’re wondering what CPU you should get, you first need to consider what exactly you will be using your computer for.
            
            If you’re looking for a new computer that you can use to browse the internet, send emails, or watch videos, you won’t need as powerful of a computer as if you were looking to play demanding games, or use your system as a workstation.
            <br>
            Or, if you’re a gamer, but you only play non-demanding games like League of Legends, you can save a bit of money by getting a more budget-friendly quad-core processor, and then either pocket the extra money, or use it to put into other components.
            
            If you’re looking to build a high-end computer for video editing, graphics design work, or high-end gaming, you’ll want to look for a higher-end processor with more cores/threads. While most games still aren’t able to fully utilize CPUs with 4 or more cores, newer games are starting to utilize more cores. And, for graphics design, video editing, and other related use cases, the extra cores/threads will bring you more performance.
            <br>
            But, ultimately, the first thing you’ll want to consider when buying a new CPU is what exactly you will be using your system for.
